A Foundation Library for Agency and Corporate Developers.

== Description ==
WPLib is a plugin designed to be used as a Must-Use plugin or to be embedded in a theme to enable the development of complex yet robust and performant WordPress applications and websites.

WPLib is a foundation library upon which robust applications can be developed. WPLib is <strong>not</strong> intended for use by end-users but instead by professional PHP developers who are tasked with building specific applications or sites on the WordPress platform by their company or their clients.

Think of developing with WPLib to be somewhat like:
<blockquote><em>"The joy of programming in Lavarel while respecting everything about WordPress that makes it an ideal platform for developing content management solutions."</em></blockquote>

The WPLib source code is hosted and development occurs [on GitHub](https://github.com/wplib/wplib/) and the documentation site will soon be located at [wplib.org](https://wplib.org).

== Installation ==
See the [docs to come soon].

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
=I have installed it and it does not do anything=
That is because it is for PHP developers, not end-users. If you are a PHP developer see the [docs to come soon] to learn more.
